# Veganism

I tend to eat as little meat as possible. At home, we don't buy it. We're [ovo-lacto-vegetarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovo-lacto_vegetarianism), but still, we try to eat as many vegan dishes as possible.

## Cool sites

### [GrimGrains](https://grimgrains.com/site/home.html)

Has recipes categorized by ingredients, meal, etc... It's very nice because it has many illustrations and pictures. It is well-designed, is open source, and it is written in C99 (not sure if that's good, but it is very cool for sure üßê)
