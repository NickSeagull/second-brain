# Note Taking

Myself, I do it digitally. Generally I follow progressive summarization, which is like GTD but for notes instead of tasks. I just type them into my To-Do list app (which is Nirvana) and store it into an "Notes" list. After that, if it requires more development, I categorize it between, three categories, which get organized in different ways:

- Personal (private): This becomes a page in my personal notes in **Notion.** I start writing it there
- Personal (not private): These are generally ideas that could be shared publicly, like fixes for bugs in a library, how did I change the cabin filter of my car, or my notetaking process. This goes into my public knowledge base, this site. (I'm in the process of porting it from Notion)
- Work: I write this directly in the project confluence

There is another category, where I just like to doodle, and brainstorm ideas, in that case I use SimpleMind for mind mapping, or One Note for writing with the Surface Pen
