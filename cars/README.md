# Cars

I don't know a whole lot about cars, but in the process of buying my 2001 Toyota Yaris, I have learned a couple of interesting things that are useful regarding choosing used cars, and repairs.

[Vicesat's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vicesat/) is **very** useful regarding this topic. Just note that it is in Spanish (although some videos have subtitles).

## Choosing a car to buy

Generally, one should avoid buying BMW, Mercedes, or Alfa Romeo. Although they are great cars, they require maintenance that their owners generally don't give them, and when that doesn't happen, they require even more. Unless you are keen on mechanics, and have knowledge, I'd avoid these.

Also, when buying a car remember their price when they were brand-new. It's not the same to repair a 50,000 EUR car than a 20,000 EUR. Although they both might cost 3,000 EUR at the time of buying it, the parts that you will replace when repairing them are generally new, and cost depending on their starting price.

When choosing a car, one should look for the following points (I bought mine in Spain, so I'll write the translation in Spanish):

* Naturally Aspirated Engine _(Motor atmosférico)_
* Engine with Timing Chain _(Motor por distribución de cadena)_
* Single Mass Clutch _(Embrague monomasa)_
* Gasoline, instead of Diesel
* Indirect Injection engine _(Inyección indirecta)_
* At least 4 cylinders
* Made in Japan, or atleast the engine

If the car meets 6 of these 7 requirements, you've found a good deal.
